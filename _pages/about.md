I'm a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Rutgers University, advised by Prof. Dimitris N. Metaxas. Previously, I graduated from Tsinghua University with a master's degree and from Wuhan University with a bachelor's degree.

My current research interest is focused on accelerated MRI reconstruction using deep learning methods trained on large-scale datasets.
