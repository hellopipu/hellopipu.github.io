I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), advised by Prof. [Dimitris Metaxas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a7VNhCIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). Previously, I received my master's degree from Tsinghua University in 2020 and my bachelor's degree from Wuhan University in 2017, both in China.

My research interest is focused on accelerated MRI reconstruction using deep learning methods trained on large-scale datasets.
