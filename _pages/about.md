I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/). , advised by Prof. [Dimitris Metaxas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a7VNhCIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). Before that, I received my master's degree from Tsinghua University and my bachelor's degree from Wuhan University in China.

My research interest is focused on accelerated MRI reconstruction using deep learning methods.
